# AUR for Petal

> Douban.FM Client With Extra - - - 一个简洁的豆瓣FM客户端。https://ilime.github.io/Petal/

This repository contains a script that will download binary file including electron and install Petal on your computer.

For example, you can install petal from AUR like `yay -S petal-bin`

**Attention:** there is another package in AUR named `petal`, which uses native electron for running Petal. Petal is not tested on the native electron that Arch provides. So if you encounter any bugs with `petal`, install `petal-bin` instead. If the bug still exists, report to [the main repository](https://ilime.github.io/Petal/).
